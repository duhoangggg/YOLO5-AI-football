Key methods : 
- __init__: init Optical Flow params  + mask only side areas to avoid tracking players
- add_adjust_positions_to_tracks: subtract camera movement to correct player positions
- get_camera_movement: compute movement using Optical Flow, save to .pkl if needed
- draw_camera_movement: overlay camera movement (X, Y) onto frames for visualization
