TeamAssigner.py
---------------
Purpose:
- Automatically assign each player to one of two teams based on jersey color using KMeans clustering.

Main Methods:

1. get_player_color():
   - Extracts the upper region of a player's bounding box (typically where the jersey is visible).
   - Applies KMeans clustering with 2 clusters to segment dominant colors in this region.
   - Compares these color clusters with the background color (from image corners) and selects the one that differs the most — assumed to be the jersey color.

2. assign_team_color():
   - Applies get_player_color() for all players in the frame.
   - Uses KMeans with 2 clusters on all player jersey colors to assign them to two teams.
   - Stores the KMeans model and the representative color of each team.

3. get_player_team():
   - Retrieves the jersey color of a new player using get_player_color().
   - Uses the trained KMeans model to assign the player to a team based on color similarity.
   - Stores the player_id ↔ team_id mapping in a dictionary for future reference.

Notes:
- Player with ID 91 is hardcoded to always belong to Team 1.
- The entire process is based solely on jersey color extraction from the image.
